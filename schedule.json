As a scientist (and failure enthusiast), I am trying to encourage my community to talk more about failure, which is difficult since the path to success is to publish about successes and to hide failures. Let's do more to talk about failure as a Maker community. Let's be honest about the dead-ends and dumb mistakes that got us to that early prototype. Rather than ridiculing 'fails', let's instead celebrate them, since they're what we learn from and allows us to become better than we are.\r\n\r\nInstead of teaching people that failure is bad, let's teach them how to be resilient to failure - give them a safe space to fail in, and provide them the encouragement to keep working towards success. \r\n\r\nAs a social experiment, I will setup a slackline at EMF Camp and invite you to come and try to slackline for the first time and *livestream you failure* with the tag #EMFailure.

Most thoughtful people, reflecting on the present trajectory of history, get the uncomfortable feeling that we are all being driven toward economic, political and ecological disaster, and that international banking has something to do with it.\r\n\r\nThis has made banking the focus of numerous conspiracy theories, most of which contain useful and verifiable information, but all of which fail in one key respect: they all subordinate the banking system to the agency of secretive groups of people who supposedly control the whole system across generations.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy scenario, bad as it is, holds out the comforting thought that if we could just identify and take out the shadowy figures who are really in control, then everything could be put right.

What if the system has its own internal logic, like a virus or an algorithm, which needs no human hand to guide it?\r\n\r\nThis talk goes back to the basic principles, and the medieval Italian and English origins, of the banking system to explore its algorithmic properties.

It is distinguished from many others in the same field by its use of 2-way communications for authentication and its use of encryption to protect the data transmissions - the majority of RFID technologies at 125KHz feature no authentication or encryption at all. As a result it has been widely used to provide secure building access and has also been used as the technology that implements car immobilisers.\r\n\r\nIn 2012, academic researchers Roel Verdult, Flavio D. Garcia and Josep Balasch published the seminal paper, \u2018Gone in 360 Seconds: Hijacking with Hitag2\u2019 that presented three attacks on the encryption system used in HiTag2. They implemented their attacks on the Proxmark 3 device (an RFID research and hacking tool) and gave several high-profile demonstrations, but didn\u2019t release any of their code or tools. Since then, the forums supporting Proxmark 3 and RFIDler (another RFID hacking tool) have received many requests for implementations of these attacks, but until recently none had been forthcoming. Garcia et al went on to produce a fast correlation attack in the 2016 paper, \u2018Lock It and Still Lose It\u2019.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will explain how HiTag2 RFID works in detail, including the PRNG and the authentication and encryption protocols, and will present my own implementations of the attacks, written for RFIDler and supported by desktop computers. The first attack uses a nonce replay to misuse the integrity protection of the comms in order to allow access to the readable RFID tag pages without needing to know the key. The second, third and fourth attacks use time/memory trade-off brute force, cryptanalytic attacks and a fast correlation attack to recover the key, such that the contents of the read-protected pages can also be accessed. The attacks are weaponised and permit cloning of tags, which I will demonstrate.", "venue": "Stage B", "may_record": true, "slug": "cracking-hitag2-crypto", "speaker": "Kev Sheldrake", "link": "https://www.emfcamp.org/line-up/2018/73", "id": 73, "is_fave": false, "user_id": 351, "title": "Cracking HiTag2 Crypto", "end_time": "18:00", "source": "database", "map_link": "https://map.emfcamp.org/#18.5/52.0418968/-2.3766391", "latlon": [52.0418968, -2.3766391], "start_date": "2018-08-31 17:10:00", "start_time": "17:10", "end_date": "2018-08-31 18:00:00"}, {"type": "talk", "description": "Have you ever wondered how to make music without buying into the world of commercial software?

We think that people with additional requirements should have the same access to technology as everyone else and people in wheelchairs and users of accessibility equipment should be seen and be seen with. We want accessible designs to be modern, funky and useful.\n\nThe accessible pixel modules are programmable coloured LED strips used as indicators, illumination, and decoration of a wheelchair, accessibility accessory, backpack or anything you might think of. powered with a 5 volt powerbank and connected to a convenient control panel. They are designed to adapt to a user\u2019s needs.\n\nThis is a workshop for other wheelchair users and their friends where they have the opportunity to make their own accessible pixel modules and also design and build their own accessories. We will bring kits for people to purchase and build their first accessible pixel module and provide a list of parts should they wish to build more on their own. We will also have parts and tools available for prototyping other accessories. We will show the basics of writing code for Arduino and how to create a finished product adapted to your needs. We will also cover basic soldering techniques and open a discussion around what other people with additional requirements need and how they can solve their own problems by creating technology.\n\nAttending this workshop will cost     \u00a320 per kit (10 Spaces Available)\nSuitable age range     Any, but with parents if under 13\nAttendees should bring     Laptop (preferable)", "is_fave": false, "title": "Designing and building your own accessibility accessories (workshop)", "end_time": "13:30", "source": "external", "map_link": "https://map.emfcamp.org/#20/52.040767817079/-2.3761563934385777", "latlon": [52.040767817079, -2.3761563934385777], "start_date": "2018-09-01 11:30:00", "start_time": "11:30", "end_date": "2018-09-01 13:30:00", "speaker": ""}, {"type": "talk", "id": -115, "venue": "Hardware Hacking Area", "may_record": false, "user_id": null, "link": "https://www.emfcamp.org/line-up/2018/external/115", "description": "Radioactivity is as fascinating as it is frightening because humans cannot sense it, and it can be dangerous in high doses.
